# react-obj-viewer

## Installation

```javascript
npm install react-obj-viewer
```

Import the ObjViewer component into your project
```jsx
    import { ObjViewer } from 'react-obj-viewer'
```
<br>
The only prop that is required is the model prop, pass in the path of the model.

```jsx
    <ObjViewer 
        model="your/obj/path/here.obj"
    />
```
If the model path is correct then model should load in the react app.
***
## Additional props and components
The ObjViewer component takes additional props to adjust the dimensions, add a material, add axis helper or a bounding box helper.

```jsx
    <ObjViewer
        model="your/obj/path/here.obj"
        material="your/material/path/here.jpg"
        width={400}
        height={400}
        axis={true}
        boundingBox={false}
    />
```
